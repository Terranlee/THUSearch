/**
 * An object cache for create-once-by-name-and-then-reuse objects. 
 * 
 * Objects are added, but never removed. Subsequent get()s using the 
 * same key will return the exact same object, UNLESS all such objects
 * have been forgotten, in which case a new object MAY be returned. 
 * 
 * This allows implementors (such as ObjectIdentityBdbCache or 
 * CachedBdbMap) to page out (aka 'expunge') instances to
 * persistent storage while they're not being used. However, as long as
 * they are used (referenced), all requests for the same-named object
 * will share a reference to the same object, and the object may be
 * mutated in place without concern for explicitly persisting its
 * state to disk.  
 * 
 * @param <V>
