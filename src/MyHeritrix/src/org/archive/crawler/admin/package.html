<body>
	Contains classes that the web UI uses to monitor and control crawls. Some
	utilities classes used exclusively or primarily for the UI are also
	included.
<p>
	Most of the heavy duty work is done by the <code>CrawlJobHandler</code>
	that manages most of the interaction between the UI and the the
	<code>CrawlController</code>. The <code>CrawlJob</code> class serves to
	encapsulate the settings needed to launch one crawl. 
</p>
<p>
	This package also provides an implementation of the Statistics Tracking
	interface that contains useful methods to access progress data. This is
	used for monitoring crawls. While it is technically possible to launch
	jobs without this statistics tracker, it would render the UI inoperable
	as far as monitoring the progress of that crawl.
